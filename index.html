              I'm Thom Groenenberg. I don't like using bulma because it makes everything look the same and just limits your creativity, but oh well. For the hackathon I've continued using this anyways and what you are looking is the product created during the given time. But hey, at least after spending about 45 minutes of figuring things out I was able to (with much trouble thanks to bulma)finally implement my own background image(which I created myself). Seriously though this program makes any unique choices incredibly difficult.

              Mushinery makes all kind of wacky music, not really paying attention to things like genres. Still the music can be easily grouped and defined once listened to. Still practicing and learning, there is always a focus on a fun experience while making music, and they believe part of this shows in the music itself. Why not go over to the listen tab and try some songs out now?

              Wuh-Oh. Seems like I'm out of time for this hackathon...
